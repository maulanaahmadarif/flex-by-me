# Flexbox Layout

The CSS3 Flexible Box, or flexbox, is a layout mode intended to accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices. For many applications, the flexible box model is easier than the block model since it does not use floats, nor do the flex container's margins collapse with the margins of its contents.
